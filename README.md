# Discover Our Parks - Email Setup
This repository is an example setup of how Discover Our Parks, LLC creates our Monthly Newsletter Emails.

## Check out the code!
To view where we start, check out the files in the `src` folder. The data is pulled from the `assets` json files and used in the `partials` files.

Using [GULP](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp), [PANINI](https://github.com/foundation/panini), and base code of [MJML](https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml), we automate the structure and setup to an easy to copy HTML file to send using our email campaign software.
